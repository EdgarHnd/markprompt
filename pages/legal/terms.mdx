If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that company or other legal entity.

**ARBITRATION NOTICE: EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF DISPUTERS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 16 AND UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE YOU FIRST AGREE TO THESE

### 2. Changes to the Terms or Services

We may modify these Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. If you continue to use the Services, you are indicating that you agree to the modified Terms.

### 10. Subscriptions and Payment

#### 10.1. Pricing

Subject to these Terms, certain features within the Services are provided to you for free up to certain limits and with limited features and certain features of the Service may require you to pay fees (**“Subscription”**). Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable. Details about the different types of Subscriptions, and the limits and available features associated with the Services, are available in the Service, under the Account settings.

You may change the type of Subscription at any time by (i) emailing us at [support@motif.land (mailto:support@motif.land) and following any instructions, if any, we provide to you in response to your change request or (ii) initiating a change through your Billing settings within the Services.

#### 10.2. Payment Terms

When you purchase a Subscription (such purchase, a **“Transaction”**) you expressly authorize us (or our third party payment processor) to charge you for such Transaction. We may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your Transaction, including, without limitation, your credit-card number, the expiration date of your credit card, and your address(es) for billing (such information, **Payment Information**). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information. When you initiate a Transaction, you authorize us to provide your Payment Information to our third party service providers so we can complete your Transaction and to charge your payment method for the type of Transaction you have selected (plus any applicable taxes and other charges). You may need to provide additional information to verify your identity before completing your Transaction (such information is included within the definition of Payment Information).

#### 10.3. Authorization for Recurring Payments

If you purchase a Subscription, you will be charged the then-applicable Subscription fee (**“Subscription Fee”**) at the beginning of your Subscription and each month, quarter or year thereafter, depending on the term of your Subscription, at the then-current rate. Subscription Fees are outlined under the Billing settings in the Service. Please note that our Subscription Fees are subject to change, although we will notify you before we effect any change in Subscription Fees.

By agreeing to these Terms and purchasing a Subscription, you acknowledge that your Subscription has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your Subscription by you or Motif. We (or our third party payment processor) will automatically charge you in accordance with term of your Subscription (e.g., each month, quarter or year), on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your Subscription, using the Payment Information you have provided. In the event your Subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, your payment method will be charged on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started a monthly Subscription on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your payment method would be billed on that date. We may also periodically authorize your payment method in anticipation of applicable fees or related charges. Your Subscription continues until cancelled by you or we terminate your access to or use of the Services or the Subscription in accordance with these Terms.

#### 10.4. Cancelling Subscriptions

You may cancel your Subscription at any time but please note that such cancellation will be effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period. YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE PAID FOR THE THEN CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION. To cancel, you can either (i) email us at [support@motif.land](mailto:support@motif.land) and follow any instructions, if any, we provide to you in response to your cancellation request, or (ii) initiate a cancellation through your Account settings within the Services. You will be responsible for all Subscription Fees (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) incurred for the then current Subscription period. If you cancel, we will allow you to access any private Projects associated with such Subscription until the most recently paid-up Subscription period ends. Cancelling your Subscription won’t cancel your Account. See Termination section below for information on terminating your Account.

Motif may suspend or terminate access to the Service, including fee-based portions of the Service, for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any the unpaid amount, including collection fees. We may, at our discretion, not delete your Project Content and User Content, but you and your Team Members will not be able to access it, unless and until you purchase a Subscription again or modify your Project Team such that it meets the limits of a free Project Team. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Motif makes no guarantees regarding the retention of your Project Content and User Content. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from cancellation of your Subscription, including, without limitation, any loss of data associated with a Project.

### 11. Term and Termination

#### 11.1. Term

These Terms are effective beginning when you accept the Terms or first access or use the Service, and ending when terminated as described in herein.

#### 11.2. Termination

We may terminate your access to and use of the Services, at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice or liability to you, provided that, if you have paid for a Subscription and the termination is not due to your breach of this Agreement, Motif will refund you any prepaid fees for the period of your Subscription that extends beyond the effective date of such termination. You may cancel your Account at any time via the Service settings, or by sending an email to us at [support@motif.land](support@motif.land). Upon any termination, discontinuation or cancellation of Services or your Account any provisions which by their nature are intended to survive will survive, including without limitation, intellectual property ownership, any licenses granted to Motif, your obligation to pay fees due to Motif, limitation of liability, disclaimers, and arbitration terms.

### 12. Warranty Disclaimers

THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. MOTIF DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING: (A) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (B) ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. MOTIF DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND MOTIF DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.

NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR MOTIF ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE MOTIF ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SERVICE AND YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE USER OR YOUR USE OF ANY CONTENT OR USER CONTENT OR YOUR PARTICIPATION NIN ANY TEAM OR PROJECT. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OTHER PERSON’S USE OF YOUR USER CONTENT OR THE RESULTS OF PUBLISHING YOUR USER CONTENT TO THE PUBLIC. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE) OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, INCLUDING USER CONTENT.

THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Motif does not disclaim any warranty or other right that Motif is prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.

### 13. Indemnity

You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Motif and its officers, directors, employees and agents, affiliates and subsidiaries (the “Motif Entities”) from and against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Service; (b) your violation of any portion of these Terms, any representation, warranty, or agreement referenced in these Terms, or any applicable law or regulation; (c) your violation of any third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; or (d) any dispute or issue between you and any third party. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), and in that case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of those claims.

### 14. Limitation of Liability

NEITHER MOTIF NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES, TOOLS, OR CONTENT WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, TOOLS, OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT MOTIF HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 16.5 AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MOTIF’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR ANY DISPUTE IN RELATION TO THE SERVICES IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO MOTIF FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING RISE TO CLAIM; OR (B) $100.

EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

### 15. Governing Law

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Motif submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms. We operate the Service from our offices in California, and we make no representation that Content included in the Service are appropriate or available for use in other locations.

### 16. Dispute Resolution for Individual Consumers

#### 16.1. Generally

In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Motif in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 16.2 and 16.3, you and Motif agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND MOTIF ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

#### 16.2. Exceptions

Despite the provisions of Section 16.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

#### 16.3. Opt-Out

If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 16 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Motif Land, Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 2261 Market Street #4059, San Francisco, CA 94114 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (**“Opt-Out Notice”**). Once Motif receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 16 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 15. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.

#### 16.4. Arbitrator

Any arbitration between you and Motif will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (**“AAA”**) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, **“AAA Rules”**) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at [www.adr.org](www.adr.org), by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Motif. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.

#### 16.5. Notice of Arbitration; Process

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (**“Notice of Arbitration”**). Motif’s address for Notice is: Motif Land, Inc., 2261 Market Street #4059, San Francisco, CA 94114. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (**“Demand”**). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Motif may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Motif must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Motif in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Motif will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.

#### 16.6. Fees

If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Motif will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in [county], [state], but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non- appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Motif for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

#### 16.7. No Class Actions

YOU AND MOTIF AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Motif agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

#### 16.8. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision

If Motif makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Motif’s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Motif’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Motif will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

#### 16.9. Enforceability

If Section 16.7 or the entirety of this Section 16 is found to be unenforceable, or if Motif receives an Opt- Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 16 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 15 will govern any conduct the arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. Unless the arbitrator finds your Claim frivolous, we’ll pay for all filing, administration and arbitrator fees if your Claim is for less than $10,000, and we won’t seek our attorneys’ fees and costs if we prevail in the arbitration. The arbitration may be conducted in writing, remotely (e.g., by videoconference) or in-person in the county where you live (or at some other location that we both agree to).

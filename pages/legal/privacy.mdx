By using our Services, you agree to the collection, use, disclosure, and procedures this Privacy Policy describes. Beyond the Privacy Policy, your use of our Services is also subject to our [Terms of Service](https://motif.land/legal/terms).

Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any content contained in User-created websites or to how those websites operate. Any information collection, use, or sharing practices by User-created websites are subject to the respective privacy policies of those websites.

**Communications**. If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you. For example, when you contact our Customer Support Team, we will receive your name, email address, the contents of a message or attachments that you may send to us, and other information you choose to provide.

We will collect the information you choose to provide on your resume, such as your education and employment experience. You may also apply through LinkedIn. If you do so, we will collect the information you make available to us on LinkedIn.

Our third party partners, such as analytics and advertising partners, may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across different services. Cookies are small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser.

## How We Use the Information We Collect

We use the information we collect:

- To provide, maintain, improve, and enhance our Services;

- To personalize your experience on our Services such as by providing tailored content and recommendations;

- To understand and analyze how you use our Services and develop new products, services, features, and functionality;

- To communicate with you, provide you with updates and other information relating to our Services, provide information that you request, respond to comments and questions, and otherwise provide customer support;

- To facilitate the connection of third party services or applications;

- For marketing purposes, such as developing and providing promotional materials that may be relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you;

## How We Share the Information We Collect

**Vendors and Service Providers.** We may share any information we receive with vendors and service providers retained in connection with the provision of our Services.

**Marketing.** We do not rent, sell, or share information about you with nonaffiliated companies for their direct marketing purposes, unless we have your permission.

**Sharing Between Users**. If you opt to share content you post with other Users on our Services or to share content publicly, your content will be shared with other Users or with the public, as you elected. For example, if you choose to share components with Users as part of the Motif Component Library, other Users will be able to see and utilize the code or other resources you’ve provided. Similarly, if you collaborate with another User on their page, we will share the contents of your contributions as well as your name, email, avatar, and a link to your profile page, with the other collaborators on the same project.

**As Required By Law and Similar Disclosures.** We may access, preserve, and disclose your information if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (a) comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (b) respond to your requests; or (c) protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety. For the avoidance of doubt, the disclosure of your information may occur if you post any objectionable content on or through the Services.

**Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers.** We may transfer your information to service providers, advisors, potential transactional partners, or other third parties in connection with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a corporate transaction in which we are acquired by or merged with another company or we sell, liquidate, or transfer all or a portion of our assets. The use of your information following any of these events will be governed by the provisions of this Privacy Policy in effect at the time the applicable information was collected.

**Consent.** We may also disclose your information with your permission.

## Your Choices

**Sharing Preferences.** We provide you with settings to allow you to set your sharing preferences for pages you create via our Services. By default, pages you create on our Services are visible only to you. If you would like, you may choose to share your pages with individuals you choose to invite to your page or alternatively you might share your page publicly. To change whether your page is private, shared with invited Users, or is publicly viewable, you can adjust the settings for that page.

**Marketing Communications.** You can unsubscribe from our promotional emails via the link provided in the emails. Even if you opt out of receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive administrative messages from us.

## Third Parties

Our Services may contain links to other websites, products, or services that we do not own or operate. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not apply to your activities on these third party services or any information you disclose to these third parties. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing any information to them.

## Security

We make reasonable efforts to protect your information by using physical and electronic safeguards designed to improve the security of the information we maintain. However, as no electronic transmission or storage of information can be entirely secure, we can make no guarantees as to the security or privacy of your information.

## Children’s Privacy

We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from children under 13 years of age, and no part of our Services is directed to children. If you learn that a child has provided us with personal information in violation of this Privacy Policy, then you may alert us at [privacy@motif.land](mailto:privacy@motif.land).

## International Visitors

Our Services are hosted in the United States and intended for visitors located within the United States. If you choose to use the Services from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your personal information outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing. Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Services. By providing any information, including personal information, on or to the Services, you consent to such transfer, storage, and processing.

## Update Your Information or Pose a Question

You can update your account information or close your account through your account settings. If you close your account, all the spaces you have created with that account will be deleted. You may also choose to delete an individual space, while preserving your account and the rest of your spaces, via your space settings. If you have questions about your privacy on the Services or this privacy policy, please contact us at [privacy@motif.land](mailto:privacy@motif.land).
